		<h1> About </h1>
		<p>
			My name is Bhaskar Singhvi, and I am currently a fourth year student at the University of Virginia pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. 
			<br>
			<br>
			My family moved to the US from India when I was 8, which entailed years of learning a new language and adapting to a whole new world. 
			Since my parents were also unfamiliar with American culture and the education system, I was required to become an independent learner early on. 
			As a shy and foreign kid, it was challenging for me to build meaningful connection with my peers at school so I diverted my energy to puzzles, reading, and self-learning as an escape.
			During my moments of self-exploration, I stumbled upon an interesting field that combined my love for video games and problem solving. 
			Delving deeper, I learned that computer science not only was a fascinating subject but it equipped me with the tools I needed to create original and exciting projects. 
			<br>
			<br>
			For me, technology is invigorating because it holds the power to empower all types of individuals. 
			It makes knowledge accessible and more importantly, it gives people the opportunity to truly impact the world and create meaningful change. 
			Ultimately, I aspire to be a lifelong learner and constantly discover ways through which I can employ my skills for good.
