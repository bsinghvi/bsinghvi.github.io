Finally I got to put together this website! I originally made a portfolio 2 years ago, though it became outdated quickly and the layout was not extensible. So this summer, I decided to re-do my porfolio with a brand new, and hopefully a nicer, layout. 

Here's a (very zoomed-out) look at my Portfolio's first version: 

<div class="align-vertical-horizontal">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/PortfolioV1.PNG" alt="PortfolioV1" width="400" height="auto" oncontextmenu="return false">
</div>

My hope with this portfolio is that through time, it can become a reference point of what I've done and how far I've come. 
I'm unsure of this blog's purpose as of now, but currently, it'll be a way for me to document any interesting topics worth sharing.
